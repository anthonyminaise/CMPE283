## Questions
1. For each member in your team, provide 1 paragraph detailing what parts of the lab that member implemented / researched. (You may skip this question if you are doing the lab by yourself).
    - I did this assignment myself.
2. Describe in detail the steps you used to complete the assignment. Consider your reader to be someone skilled in software development but otherwise unfamiliar with the assignment. Good answers to this question will be recipes that someone can follow to reproduce your development steps.
    - Started by cloning the linux repo from torvalds to my Ubuntu VM
    - After the clone finished, I initially ran the "Building the Kernal" terminal lines to get things started and see how running the kernal works
        - Learned the hard way that the first time running it takes a few hours
    - Identify where the cpuid.c and vmx.c file is
        - cpuid.c can be found in linux/arch/x86/kvm 
        - vmx.c can be found in linux/arch/x86/kvm/vmx
    - Started with looking at cpuid.c to make changes there to add the case on if eax = 0x4FFFFFFF
        - Found that the very last method holds the emulation code, so I added an if else statement to handle the case, do the proper assignment to the registers, and output to the console.
    - Looked at vmx.c to see if there are any necessary changes needed to accommodate the changes in cpuid.c
3. Comment on the frequency of exits â€“ does the number of exits increase at a stable rate? Or are there more exits performed during certain VM operations? Approximately how many exits does a full VM boot entail?
